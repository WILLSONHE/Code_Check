Many products that we use have an identification number that may or may not have a bar-code. Some examples are books, electronics, grocery items, credit cards, money orders, driverâ€™s license, etc. The identification number helps encode the information about the product. These numbers are usually separated by a space or a hyphen and each part holds specific information about the product; UPC codes (Universal Product Codes) are examples of such codes that are formed as bar codes and used for identifying merchandise. A check digit is added to the identification number (usually the last digit). This digit is used to verify the identification number for its legitimacy.
